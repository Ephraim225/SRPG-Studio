//Randomizer by Ephraim225
//This very simple code lets you make an array of possible values; the game will select one at random.
//The idea being you can run this in an Execute Script command for every character to grant them a random class from a list of possible classes.
//But you can do whatever you like with it. Just note that it returns the result so be sure to store that to a variable!
